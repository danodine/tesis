# Tesis - QoS Parameters of VoIP in MANET Networks

This repository contains my thesis project, which focuses on analyzing the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET).

## Overview

The research addresses the performance evaluation of VoIP services within MANETs, emphasizing parameters such as jitter, packet loss, latency, and throughput. The objective is to analyze and propose improvements for efficient VoIP communication in dynamic, infrastructure-less networks.

### Structure

docs/: Contains documentation, research papers, and reference material.

simulations/: Scripts and simulation files used for testing network performance.

results/: Data collected and analyzed during the thesis.

presentation/: Slides and supplementary materials from thesis presentations.

### Requirements

Network simulation software (e.g., NS-2, NS-3, or OMNeT++)

Basic knowledge of VoIP technology and MANET architecture

### Installation & Usage

To replicate the simulations and analyses:

### Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/danodine/tesis.git

Follow instructions provided in the specific folders (simulations/, docs/) to set up your environment and execute the tests.

### Contributing

Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are welcome. Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
